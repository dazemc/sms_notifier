# sms_notifier
Asks for a number as an input and sends a message to that number via sms with minimal error handling. 
This uses Twilio API and requires enviroment variables TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, TWILIO_NUMBER
to be set before use. 
A keypad is the minimal peripheral that will be needed though I plan to use flet for a full GUI and intergrate touchscreen control
